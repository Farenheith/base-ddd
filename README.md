# base-ddd

WIP

Base project for creation of DDD + Command driven projects using typescript and inversify, aimed to be the base of an api node project.

It's not meant to be cloned, but to be installed as a npm package.

This packages uses Express objects to manipulate de api information, thought it doesn't use Express as a Http Server. This approach had been made because the initial focus is to create a base package to patternalize my own firebase function projects, which support to answer request in the Express pattern
